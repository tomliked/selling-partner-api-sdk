## PHP SDK for Selling Partner API

The Selling Partner API SDK for PHP enables you to easily connect your PHP application to Amazon's REST-based SP-API.

* [Learn more about SP-API](https://developer.amazonservices.com/)
* [API Documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/)

### Getting started

#### Credentials

Before you can use the SDK, you need to be registered as a Selling Partner API developer. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/sp-api-registration-overview).
You also need to register your application to get valid credentials to call SP-API. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/registering-your-application).
If you are already registered successfully, you can find instructions on how to view your credentials in the [documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/viewing-your-application-information-and-credentials).

## Installation & Usage

### Minimum Requirements

To run the SDK you need PHP 8.1 or higher.


### Manual Installation

By using the download files, composer dependencies are already installed. You only need to include `autoload.php`:

```php
<?php
require_once('/path/to/OpenAPIClient-php/vendor/autoload.php');
```

### Use the SDK

In order to call one of the APIs included in the Selling Partner API, you need to:
* Configure credentials and marketplace ids. We provided a .env file to test the SDK in php/sdk/.env
* Create an instance for a specific API (e.g. Orders API)
* Call an operation

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

use SpApi\AuthAndAuth\LWAAuthorizationCredentials;
use SpApi\AuthAndAuth\LWAAuthorizationSigner;
use SpApi\Api\OrdersApi;
use SpApi\Configuration;


// Set up LWA credentials
$lwaAuthorizationCredentials = new LWAAuthorizationCredentials([
"clientId" => "amzn1.application-**************",
"clientSecret" => "***********",
"refreshToken" => "***********",
"endpoint" => "https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token"
]);

// Initialize LWAAuthorizationSigner instance
$lwaAuthorizationSigner = new LWAAuthorizationSigner($lwaAuthorizationCredentials);
$config = new Configuration([], $lwaAuthorizationCredentials);

// Setting SP-API endpoint region
$config->setHost('https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com');

// Create a new HTTP client
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

// Create an instance of the Orders Api
$api = new OrdersApi($config, null, $client);

try {
// Call getOrders
$result = $api->getOrders(
$marketplace_ids = ['ATVPDKIKX0DER'],
$created_after = '2024-01-01'
);
print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
echo 'Exception when calling OrderApi->getOrders: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}



```
